HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM). 
Allows use of both dynamic typing and static typing. This kind of a type system is called gradual typing, which is also implemented in other programming languages such as ActionScript.
Hack's type system allows types to be specified for function arguments, function return values, and class properties; however, types of local variables are always inferred and cannot be specified.

// perf
microtime() is a built-in PHP function that allows you to measure the current Unix timestamp with microsecond precision. This function is particularly useful when you need to benchmark your code, identify performance bottlenecks, or simply measure the time taken for the execution of specific parts of your script.
